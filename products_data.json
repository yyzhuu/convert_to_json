The company known for Soundblaster finally has a new killer product, and you'll probably want one too. - Aloysius Low, CNET The device also made straightforward stereo music tracks sound MAGICAL, as if you were in the room with the musicians playing live. - Michael Brown, TechHive Staff Few things in technology are guaranteed to bring you actual joy, but Creative's Super X-Fi just might qualify for that list. - PC World Our minds were simply blown away when we heard what Holography can do for audio. This isn't virtual surround, that stuff is so last year. This is true spacial audio processing and it comes on that tiny little dongle! - Eteknix By processing your headphones' signal in a way that makes your content sound like you were listening to an impossibly elegant home theater system, you can bring the theater experience with you wherever you go\u07ea - Android Authority The SXFI Air is one of the most compelling pairs of headphones at CES 2019. - TechRadar When we understood the concept of Super X-Fi, the results were nothing short of amazing. The headphones didn't feel like headphones anymore. Creative definitely had many, many, many \u2018wows' coming from their suite at CES 2019. - Overclock This amp has dramatically changed how I enjoy music: it's fun to listen to high school classics with the amp activated, making it difficult to return to listening without it. - Sound Guys I had a listen and was left amazed. Super X-Fi showed a lot of promise. - Kenny Yeo, Associate Editor,  Hardware Zone (Using Super X-Fi) I heard game clips and it was insanely effective. INSANE. - Mark Henninger, Senior Editor, AVS Forum .. no one in the industry could solve this decade's-long problem. Creative's Super X-Fi could be the game changer. - The Neo Dimension Hands down, this was the best demo of CES\u2014and it's the product I'm most looking forward to reviewing this year. - PCWorld Creative has the demo to beat at this year's CES. The company is showing an early prototype of a product it calls Super X-Fi Headphone Audio. And it blew my mind. - TechHive What the F***?!! . . . It was really something else I think, all of us, there was a collective gasp when the technology was demonstrated to us . . . its feels like big leap forward - Wong Renhao (Content Producer, Tech In Asia) Creative ... looks to have finally cracked the issue of fitting full sized speakers into a pair of portable cans... I heard it through the earphones in exactly the same way I heard it via the speakers, and it was nothing short of AMAZING. - Sherwin Loh, GeekCulture It was an amazing experience totally! I've been in the business for 40 years, and that's some of the best sound I've heard. And for the price point you're going to sell it for, IT'S OBSCENE. - John R. Ross (CES 2018 Audio Industry Veteran) I just finished the best demo of the show. It's not a curved TV, it's not 8K, it is, wait for it, Creative Lab's new Super X-Fi technology...And it just floors you ... it's gonna be a steal at US$150. - Gordon Ung, Executive Editor, PCWorld Well the fact that it's going to be everyone's hands, you know, a product that everyone can afford, and it's something that is literally going to change the way people listen to things by that one little dongle. - Vernon A (Radio DJ, Class 95) For a while there, I actually thought that the speakers were on, and that there was nothing coming through both cans, until I took them off to hear nothing emanating from the speakers. - GeekCulture This Holographic-Sound Headphone Dongle BLEW MY MIND. This mind-blowing audio technology uses acoustic mapping and holographic sound to create a headphone experience that's nearly indistinguishable from what you'd get out of a dedicated set of surround speakers. - Michael Andronico, Tom's Guide You can take the headphones off, listening to again; a three\u2014 or four\u2014thousand Dolby Atmos system, and put the headphones on, and it will sound just as good. In fact for my ears, I gotta say, it sounded better. - Gordon Ung, Executive Editor, PCWorld I listened to the demo and it was MIND-BLOWING! The surround sound I heard from the headphone was amazing and I even took the headphones off just to confirm that I wasn't hearing the sound from the physical surround speakers. Judging from the guests' reactions, they were equally or almost as impressed as I am. - The Neo Dimension If you're curious about what \u2018audio holography' is, Creative Labs has the goods with its Super X-Fi technology. I gave it a good listen at CES 2018, and it sounded glorious! After hearing the results, I was simply blown away. Even with all the audio products I've tested over the years, my ears were never subjected to anything quite like this. - Ted Kritsonis, Mobile Syrup During the audition, the Super X-Fi system created a realistic sense of space as I listened to a soundtrack. It took the audio that would have been usually stuck between my ears and projected \u0093outside\u0094 the confines of my head. I was able to pinpoint the sound sources in a room as well as gauge the distance between them. - Wilson Wong, TechGoondu I know, it's unbelievable that the little \u2018dongle' above can give you sound as good as a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround System (Dolby Atmos 5.1.2) but it absolutely does! - Rylind Corolis, GameTyrant As an audio engineer I readily claim that most \u2018virtual' surround sound applications are junk - until now. Creative Lab's Super X-Fi blew me away. - Adam Patrick Murray, PC World Staff What impresses me the most is how Super X-Fi managed to turn a standard 2.0 music track into a realistic live surround effect. It is done so well that it's as if the artist is singing RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. - Warren, KLGadgetGuy I was absolutely blown away by a demo of the final, shipping product at CES 2019. It 100% matched the positioning and perceived distance of the real 7-channel surround system in the room. Absolutely could not tell it was headphones and HAD to take them off to be totally sure. - AVS Forum Smaller than a pack of chewing gum, the SXFI AMP is unique in simulating the sound of speakers, and the surround effect is far more convincing than any 7.1 headphone in the market. - AVMania Creative gave voice to the personal computer when it introduced the first SoundBlaster sound card all those years ago. And now it makes a similar revolution by allowing headphones to faithfully reproduce the \"holographic\" sound. - Aktualne Sure, plenty of headphones reviews will go on and on about a wide soundstage, but they'll stop that their tongues wagging and start their jaws dropping once they've heard Super X-Fi. - Tech Buyer's Guru This is by far one of our favorite smiles to have ever crossed our face when it comes to audio. - POC Network It's like nothing I've ever heard before. Without Super X-Fi, music sounds flat. With the dongle, it actually sounds like you're at the studio or a concert. This is the best thing I saw or heard all week at CES. - WFMZ Super X-Fi headphone amp pretty much made headphones come to life. - TechYesCity of  Reviews+ Learn MoreGEN2 IS HERE!Super X-Fi Gen2 is a result of our continuous research effort.

        "overview": "Riding the success of the critically acclaimed Sound Blaster Roar, the Sound Blaster Roar Pro raises the bar for portable Bluetooth speakers with its improved 5-driver system that is powered by two high-performance amplifiers. The Roar Pro is also made for professionals in their respective fields. Pair with Creative iRoar Mic (sold separately), and you'll get a wireless personal PA system (Public Address system) for presentations, conferences or even karaoke sessions!The Sound Blaster Roar HeritageStaying true to the Sound Blaster Roar Heritage, the Roar Pro portable Bluetooth speaker continues to live up to the critically acclaimed sound signature and battle the laws of the acoustic engineering by packing all the awesome components and technology to bring you all that audio power within a compact enclosure, no larger than the size of a booklet. The Roar Pro now raises the bar for portable Bluetooth speakers with further enhancements: Improved 5-driver system, three preset audio profiles, longer battery life, and its ability to transform into a wireless personal PA system when paired with iRoar Mic (sold separately). Improved 5-driver SystemThe drivers are more sensitive, thus delivering louder and brighter audio Three Preset Audio ProfilesWarm, Neutral or Energetic to go with the music genre, tailored to your listening habits; Improved Battery Life  Longer battery life from the optimised electrical design Wireless Personal PA System  For expressing yourself better in presentations, conferences or even serenading your love.AudioMonocoque ChassisMinimizing energy wastage to deliver better audio qualityHigh-frequency DriversDelivering balanced highs and far-field high-frequency dispersionActive 2.5\u2033 DriverPumping out impressive bass and directed upwards to stabilize the speakerPassive RadiatorsOffering more bass enhancement and widening the soundstageClean, Powerful BassThe active 2.5\u2033 driver pumps out impressive bass. Directing the audio upwards not only stabilizes the speaker, but also provides for a wider soundstage that doesn't require the listener to be situated in the audio sweet spot.Even More Bass EnhancementIt is further enhanced with dual opposing, side-firing passive radiators that widen the soundstage dramatically.Acoustically Optimised Speaker DesignThe rigid monocoque endoskeleton chassis has fewer internal components that vibrate individually. This translates into lesser energy wastage and better audio quality.Compact, Powerful, High Frequency DriversDurable and lightweight improved high frequency drivers deliver balanced highs. These dual 1.5\u2033 premium drivers are also designed to provide far-field high frequency dispersion.Bi-Amplified Design: Two Amps, Not OneMost portable speakers utilise a single amplifier to reproduce the entire audio spectrum. With a single amplifier design, much demand goes into reproducing the lows and mids, which compromises the delivery of the highs. On the other hand, the Roar Pro utilises two amplifiers - one dedicated to driving lows and mids, while the other is solely dedicated to deliver the high frequencies. This allows the speaker to produce uncompromisingly clear, high definition, and well-balanced music. The top firing bass and mid level driver is laid horizontally, reducing the speaker's centre of gravity, thus stabilising it.Space-filling DispersionWhile many other portable speakers produce small, constrained sound, the Roar Pro is designed to deliver space-filling audio. That's because we have incorporated far-field high frequency drivers in the Roar Pro, and these project audio further than other speakers of its class. This is complemented by the boxer-style layout, which also delivers a room-filling, non-sweet spot-specific audio experience.ROAR: Instant No-holds-barred Audio PowerMost portable speakers either focus on audio power, thus compromising audio fidelity, or vice versa; removing the power of choice from end users. The Roar Pro is designed to be different. By default, it produces balanced, high-fidelity audio. And in scenarios where sheer audio power is needed - in large parties and social gatherings, for instance - users can press the ROAR button that instantly boosts the loudness, depth and spaciousness of the audio.TeraBass: Pronounced Bass Even at Low VolumeThe Roar Pro's TeraBass is an intelligent feature that provides bass boost to compensate for the loss of perceived bass during low-level listening, such as at night or less-than-ideal acoustic environments. The bass compensation level will be reduced as the playback volume increases till it reaches the maximum dynamic output, where no processing is applied. Also, TeraBass can be switched off if the bass compensation is not desired.Multiple Audio ProfilesTake your audio experience beyond your favourite artist's potential. With the Roar Pro, you can switch between different preset audio profiles with an easy-to-use three-way switch. Select Warm for soothing audio, Neutral for balanced audio, or Energetic for a lively audio experience.Read on for recommended audio profiles customised for your favourite music genre(s).Advanced High Definition Audio Codecs \u2014 aptX\u00ae Low Latency and AACThe Roar Pro supports the latest Bluetooth technology, aptX Low Latency codec. It is highly recommended for synchronising your audio and video, thus bringing out the best in your entertainment. Unlike many premium wireless speakers, the Roar Pro also supports aptX and AAC, which are advanced HD codecs that deliver high quality audio for Bluetooth transmission. These codecs are crucial for great wireless audio that are also supported by branded Android phones and iPhone.High Quality Wireless Audio for Your ComputerWith the BT-W2 USB Transceiver (sold separately) featuring Bluetooth and aptX, you can also stream high-fidelity stereo music wirelessly from your PC and laptops without wires. Its easy and fuss-free installation requires no software - just plug and play!iRoar MicNext Generation Wireless Personal PA SystemAlso made for professionals, this powerful Bluetooth speaker doubles as a wireless personal PA system, helping you deliver a compelling performance in your presentation, conference, classes, or even karaoke sessions!

Lightweight Unidirectional MicWeighing at 30 grams only, with a battery life of 10 hours1, the iRoar Mic (sold separately) can be held, clipped or hung for versatile and convenient speech delivery and performance. The iRoar Mic also comes with a line-in jack that allows you to mix music from your mobile device, giving you wireless karaoke sessions!Portability10 Hour Battery LifeWith the same high-capacity built-in 6000mAh Li-ion battery as the Sound Blaster Roar, the Roar Pro has a longer battery life that lasts up to 10 hours1, thanks to its optimised electrical design. Now you can enjoy non-stop hits from dusk till dawn.USB-chargingOut of juice? No worries, you have two ways to recharge your Roar Pro - with the included power adaptor for fast charge2 and/or the micro USB.Dual Purpose ChargingThe Roar Pro also doubles as a battery bank for your smartphone, whenever you need backup power.ConnectivityEnjoy Your Audio Wirelessly via BluetoothConnect your Roar Pro wirelessly to your smart devices via Bluetooth.

The SXFI CARRIER carries on the engineering marvel of the award-winning Sonic Carrier which has been dubbed by industry experts as the \u0093soundbar of the gods\u0094.Jointly developed by Creative and Dolby Laboratories, SXFI CARRIER has the same sound signature as the 15.2 Sonic Carrier at less than half the size and at a fraction of the price. Even with a scaled-down size, SXFI CARRIER can transform your living room to provide a full-fledged cinema experience.When there's a need to enjoy your movies privately at night without disturbing your family or neighbors, put on SXFI THEATER headphones (optional) to enjoy the same cinematic experience as you would on the soundbar.It seemed like it is very real. Even though the whole soundbar is in front of me, I could hear the water and nature sounds happening behind me.I can feel myself immersed, as though I'm in the cinema itself. The vocals [and] the clarity of the soundbar is very good....it's the world's smallest Dolby Atmos soundbar, so for those with space constraints it is excellent.It's quite unexpecting that a single soundbar can give you this level of immersiveness....the surround sound feels very lifelike and real.Sounds amazing, as if you are in a cinema.Read more reviews hereDolby X CreativeThe SXFI CARRIER is the first-of-its-kind Dolby Atmos\u00ae Speaker System (DASS) soundbar, featuring Dolby's new innovative acoustics concept that pushes the performance limits and capability of a compact soundbar to a whole new dimension.We are thrilled to have partnered with Creative to bring this first-of-its-kind sound bar experience to consumers around the world. Consumers will be able to enjoy a breathtaking Dolby Atmos experience through an innovative acoustic design developed by Dolby, which is unheard of from such a small compact form factor.Mahesh Balakrishnan,Vice President, Dolby LaboratoriesFrom the soundbar of the gods to the SXFI CARRIER with the same team that worked behind the scenes of our 15-driver Sonic Carrier, we managed to develop a soundbar that is capable of producing the same sound signature as the Sonic Carrier, at less than half the size, and at a fraction of the price.Unyielding Engineering ExcellenceWith our decades of audio expertise, we designed and tested numerous prototype soundbars candidates to select the best for the SXFI CARRIER. This involves even more prototype speaker drivers of different shapes and size, positioned in all kinds of angling to finally arrive at the perfect Dolby Atmos\u00ae acoustics signature.Only with this unyielding resolve in attaining engineering excellence were we able to achieve this new soundbar\u00a0dimension.READ MOREHow the SXFI CARRIER was developedSXFI CARRIER defies the odds of driving high power output in the most compact form factor possible to deliver powerful audio reproduction without distortion\u2014a feat that is unachievable without expertise, patience, and specially-crafted audio components.The soundbar features a 7-driver system where each driver in the soundbar is individually driven by its own dedicated DSP-controlled amplifier. The arrangement of these drivers follows closely to a Dolby-designed acoustics concept, each crafted using top-notch, audiophile-grade components to deliver high-resolution audio for the ultimate home cinema experience.The soundbar is accompanied by the redesigned, compact yet powerful wireless subwoofer to deliver the requisite bass performance that completes a compelling soundbar solution, and that can rival the real cinema experience.The Dolby-designed acoustics concept wouldn't have been possible without our very own team's cutting-edge electronics design and audio engineering know-how. Together with Dolby, and after a series of iterative modifications and listening tests to determine the design parameters, the SXFI CARRIER is finally here.ProductCreative SXFI CARRIERCreative Sonic CarrierPerformanceDrivers7.115.1Audio Quality24-bit 192 kHz24-bit 192 kHzSystem Power450W RMS900W Peak1000W RMS2000W PeakAudio TechnologiesDolby Atmos\u00aeSupports 5.1.2, 7.1.2 Audio ChannelsDolby TrueHDDolby Digital PlusCreative's Super X-Fi\u00ae Spatial HolographyCreative's SuperWide\u0099 technologyDolby Atmos\u00aeSupports 5.1.2, 7.1.2 Audio ChannelsDolby TrueHDDolby Digital PlusCreative's SuperWide X-FiCreative's SuperWide\u0099 technologyDTS:XDimensionSoundbarL x W x H:880 x 128 x 76 mm / 34.6\u2033 x 5\u2033 x 3\u2033L x W x H:1521 x 151 x 96 mm / 59.9\u2033 x 5.9\u2033 x 3.8\u2033Wireless SubwooferL x W x H:225 x 430 x 450 mm / 8.9\u2033 x 16.9\u2033 x 17.7\u2033L x W x H:306 x 531 x 582 mm / 12\u2033 x 20.9\u2033 x 22.9\u2033PRICE (SRP)US $999.99US $5,999.99AudioHear Each and Every SyllableEver watched a show where its cinematic sound effects were so overwhelming, you couldn't hear what the characters were saying? Increasing the volume makes it worse, because everything gets louder across the board, including the dramatic special effects.We've resolved this on SXFI CARRIER by integrating our custom-designed, low distortion drivers with intelligent dialogue enhancing algorithm to deliver unusually clear, full bodied, and intelligible dialogue. This is then further enhanced by our dialogue processing technology, where the soundbar is purposefully tuned to intelligently detect and enhances vocals and spoken dialogue, making it easy for you to follow the story.Surround All Around YouThat familiar surround sound experience that you know from the cinema? It's now available, in the comfort of your home. With the personal involvement from Dolby's experts in which Dolby Atmos\u00ae surround technology is implemented, the SXFI CARRIER is set to provide you with the ultimate cinematic experience, and for all content that supports Dolby Atmos\u2014even streamed ones like Netflix, Apple TV, and Prime Video.READ MOREDolby Atmos\u00ae surround tuning with Dolby's expertsHeight and spatial elements are important for a realistic portrayal of the drama and emotional turmoil of a great film.Dolby Atmos\u00ae renders everything\u2014from dialogue, to quiet scenes, to whirlwind action\u2014with astonishing clarity, richness, detail, and depth. Unlike normal surround sound, with Dolby Atmos, sound moves around you in three-dimensional space. It adds an overhead dimension where a new sensation of height immerses you in the action, creating a full audio atmosphere and realistically depicting the objects moving overhead\u2014like a helicopter in a war zone, or a songbird fluttering from tree to tree.What sets the SXFI CARRIER apart from other Dolby Atmos speakers is the involvement from Dolby acoustics experts since conceptualization.In accordance to the strict audio directivity guidelines from Dolby, we created waveguides that direct the sound from our height speakers in a controlled manner toward the ceiling, and then reflected back down at the viewer to achieve the effects. More importantly, audio sounds like it's coming from outside and above the soundbar as intended, rather than sounding like it's originating from the soundbar itself.All About That BassFitted with a 10\u0094 driver in a deceptively small enclosure, the accompanying wireless subwoofer punches way above its weight. You'll catch yourself holding your breath subconsciously as the smooth, yet remarkably powerful bass reverberates through the entire room. The scale and drama that we all know and love from cinemas\u2014made possible by this compact subwoofer with a huge bass.READ MOREOur Bass Engineering EffortsIt's difficult to achieve an accurate and powerful bass performance across rooms of different sizes and shapes, and we worked through the challenge with countless of experiments testing subwoofer enclosure of varying sizes.We then applied the combination of the acoustics design and DSP processing for the meticulous calculation of the bass response frequency to cater for room gains, guaranteeing optimum bass reproduction across different rooms types.And this is the fruit of our labor! The SXFI CARRIER's subwoofer produces impressive bass extension, power, and quality to deliver clean, impactful bass that digs deep, without booming or sounding muddy. It's also detailed and precise, without distortion, nor leaving you feeling overwhelmed.Super X-FiBest of Both WorldsBeen binge-watching the entire day and you need to switch over to headphones before the neighbours complain about the noise? If the thought of going back to stereo audio in your headphones is unbearable for you, Super X-Fi is bound to blow your mind.Our Super X-Fi Spatial Holography recreates the soundstage of a surround speaker system in headphones, and personalizes it for you with Artificial Intelligence for a natural listening experience. Dolby Atmos cinema experience will be faithfully recreated with Super X-Fi.On the SXFI CARRIER, Super X-Fi is available through a 3.5 mm headphone jack for any of your headphones, although a Super X-Fi certified one would be preferred. However, for the ultimate audio enjoyment, we strongly recommend using the low-latency wireless Creative SXFI THEATER headphones (optional).Movies that are played over headphones with Super X-Fi sounds as spatially convincing and believable as they would within a cinema, or a multi-speaker setup, but with the benefit of audio privacy without disturbing your neighbors (and family) even when it's late into the night.

Please note that voice chat for Nintendo Switch is title-dependent, and requires additional firmware to activate the analog microphone. Please refer to the FAQ section below for more information.ConvenienceEASY CODEC SELECTIONCreative BT-W3 supports 4 different Bluetooth codecs\u2014aptX LL, aptX HD, aptX, and SBC. Each of the codec has its own strengths and is suitable for different use cases: aptX LL is essential for a lag-free gaming experience, while aptX HD is ideal for music enjoyment. With the indicator light and codec selection button, you can easily tell which codec you're using and switch to the suitable codec for your usage effortlessly.aptX\u0099 Low LatencyaptX\u0099 HDaptX\u0099SBCCreative BT-W3 works with Bluetooth headphones or speakers, and the codecs available to you are dependent on what your headphones and speakers support\u2014i.e. you need a pair of headphones that support aptX LL to use it with Creative BT-W3! If you're unsure of the codecs supported by your Bluetooth devices, you either check its manufacturer website, or check our FAQ section below.As long as your Bluetooth device support the corresponding codec, Creative BT-W3 will default to aptX LL first, with aptX HD next in priority, then aptX, and finally SBC.AudioNEVER MISS A BEAT WITH APTX LOW LATENCYLatency is a common problem with Bluetooth headphones due to the time required to decode audio. As a result, you may get out-of-sync audio while playing games or watching movies. With aptX Low Latency, you can say goodbye to that annoying lag! This audio codec is engineered to reduce latency to 30-40 milliseconds, which is practically indiscernible by humans. That is 4-6 times shorter than the amount of latency you get with the default SBC codec! Connect your aptX LL compatible headphones to Creative BT-W3 to enjoy seamless transmissions and real-time audio synchronization, without any sacrifice in audio quality!ConnectivityPLUG AND PLAYDesigned with convenience as the main goal, the setup for Creative BT-W3 can't be any easier.Here's how to do it:STEP 1:Plug the Creative BT-W3 into PS4 / PS5 / Nintendo Switch / PC / Mac.STEP 2:Press Bluetooth button for 2 seconds until the indicator light flashes blue to indicate pairing mode. Go into pairing mode on your Bluetooth audio playback device as well.STEP 3:Wait for your device to connect with Creative BT-W3.And you're done. In fact, you can skip step 2 the next time you want to use Creative BT-W3 with the same pair of headphones.For devices with USB-A port, we've bundled a USB Type C-to-A converter to use with Creative BT-W3. Simply connect Creative BT-W3 to the converter first before plugging it into your device, and that's it. Then, you can follow the simple 3-step process above and you're done. Easy, huh.NO BATTERIES NEEDEDCreative BT-W3 is powered by USB-C and draws minimal power from the connected device. As long as it's plugged in, it'll always be switched on.The Creative BT-W3 is also completely battery-free so you don't have to worry about charging yet another device!COMMUNICATE WIRELESSLY WITH YOUR TEAMMATESShare your strategy or call for urgent back-up from your teammates when playing multiplayer games! Clear communication is key to winning the game, that's why we bundled a detachable microphone for you to use with your PS4 controller!Simply plug the microphone into the 3.5 mm jack on your controller to communicate freely and lead your team to victory. Alternatively, you can also go into HFP mode by double pressing the button on your Creative BT-W3, and use the built-in mic on your headset for a quick call or for your online meetings.For Nintendo Switch users, to use the analog microphone for in-game voice chat, simply download a firmware to enable the function.Do note that enabling the analog mic for Nintendo Switch will turn off the HFP mode on your Creative BT-W3. Read More.F.A.Q.How do I know if my headphones or speakers are compatible with the codecs offered by Creative BT-W3?To be able to use the aptX codecs, your playback device has to support the respective codecs. If you're unsure of the codecs supported by your devices, you can check their compatibility with aptX, aptX LL, and aptX HD here.If your playback device does not support aptX codecs, it can still connect with Creative BT-W3 via the SBC codec, which is the basic Bluetooth codec supported by all Bluetooth headphones or speakers. However, you will not be able to enjoy the higher audio quality of the aptX codecs.Can Creative BT-W3 pair with 2 headphones simultaneously?Unfortunately, no. We care about providing you with best audio quality and user experience possible with a hassle-free product. Providing simultaneous streaming to 2 headphones compromises on performance both in terms of connection stability and audio quality. This is because the function requires the device to perform alternate streaming at very fast intervals to both headphones, and this causes latency and audio synchronization issues. Moreover, the connection will always default to the lower codec of the 2 headphones and this leads to lower audio quality. We made a measured consideration in the decision of this function, and went with the option that provides the best audio and user experience you can get at the best value.Can I use Creative BT-W3 with my phone?Yes, you can! You can use the Creative BT-W3 with any device that streams audio through its USB port that complies with USB Audio Standard.Due to the wide variety of mobile phones and operating systems that may have different implementation of digital audio streaming through USB-C, it is not recommended for you to purchase this with the sole purpose on using it for your mobile devices.You will have to approach your mobile device manufacturer to check if your mobile device is compliant with the USB Audio Standard.How do I use Creative BT-W3 with PS4\u0099 or Nintendo Switch\u0099 in dock mode?Simply connect Creative BT-W3 to the USB C-to-A converter provided, and plug it into one of the USB-A ports on the PlayStation console or Nintendo Switch dock to enjoy wireless gaming!Can I use the Analog Microphone included with my Nintendo Switch?For the analog microphone to work with Nintendo Switch, you'd have to download the HFP-off firmware to enable the function. Do note that enabling the analog mic for Nintendo Switch will turn off the HFP mode on your Creative BT-W3. This is necessary because the Nintendo Switch does not allow for input and output audio to be from different devices. When HFP mode is enabled on your BT-W3, the Switch will auto-register it as the input device, and the analog microphone, or any other external microphones, cannot be enabled. You can turn HFP on again with the HFP-on firmware. Please also note that its voice chat function is title-dependent. You can use the microphone with games that have built-in chat function like Fortnite and Overwatch. Otherwise, it will not work for Nintendo Switch.Can I control volume through my Bluetooth headphones while connected to Creative BT-W3?For Bluetooth headphones with the AVRCP profile, you can control playback volume through your Bluetooth headphones. For devices without AVRCP profile, you might only be adjusting the volume of your headphones, not the device Creative BT-W3 is connected to. The volume control synchronization between headset and connected device is dependent on headset manufacturer's implementation.Will BT-W3 draw a lot of power from my phone or Nintendo Switch in handheld mode?No, the Creative BT-W3 draws less than 40mA even when using the most power-intensive codec. That is about 1% of most phones' battery, and less than 1% of Nintendo Switch's battery.My laptop already has Bluetooth, why would I still need this device?Most laptops come with the most basic Bluetooth chipset with few or only one codec option. With Creative BT-W3, you can enjoy more premium codecs for better wireless audio enjoyment\u2014you'd have access to aptX LL, a low latency codec that is essential for watching videos or playing games; you can also enjoy higher definition audio with the aptX HD codec for better music enjoyment. And most importantly, you are able to switch to the preferred codec anytime the situation calls for it.Why is my BT-W3 unable to enter pairing mode?Some Bluetooth devices broadcast their pairing aggressively and this forces BT-W3 to exit pairing mode. To avoid this problem, turn off Bluetooth on your PC, Mac, PS4 or Nintendo Switch temporarily if you experience difficulty.Can I use the mic from my Bluetooth headphones for voice call instead of the analog microphone?Yes, you can use your Bluetooth headset for calls in HFP mode, which can be activated by pressing the button on Creative BT-W3 twice. The LED indicator will turn solid red, indicating HFP mode is active. Do note that in HFP mode, the high-quality audio streaming capabilities of A2DP Bluetooth codecs (i.e. aptX LL, aptX HD, aptX, and SBC) will not be available. This is because HFP is a different Bluetooth profile which supports voice back, while A2DP does not.The analog microphone will allow you to use voice chat while streaming audio on A2DP codecs at the same time. However, due to it being a near-field microphone, it is not suitable for use with laptops and computers due to the position of the 3.5 mm audio jack, and the likelihood of it picking up your keyboard sounds.Why does the Analog Mic not work on my PS4?If your analog mic is not working on your PS4, it's most likely due to the new feature introduced in PS4's firmware 7.50. To reinstate the mic capabilities, please follow the steps below to set-up your Creative BT-W3 again:Go to \u0093Settings\u0094 on PS4 homepageSelect \u0093Devices\u0094Select \u0093Audio Devices\u0094Uncheck \u0093Switch Output Device Automatically\u0094Ensure that Creative BT-W3 is connected to an available USB port, and the Analog Microphone to the PS4 controller's headset jack.Ensure the following:\u0093Input Device\u0094 is \u0093Headset Connected to Controller\u0094\u0093Output Device\u0094 is \u0093USB Headset (Creative BT-W3)\u0094*Reconnect either device if neededUnder \u0093Output to Headphones\u0094, select \u0093All Audio\u0094Is BT-W3 compatible with Apple AirPod or AirPod Pro?Yes; however, AirPod Pro with firmware FW3A283 seems to exhibit abnormality in music playback and HFP mode with BT-W3 as well as other Bluetooth transmitters. Please approach Apple Support for further assistance."

Two-way Noise CancellationNoise is the enemy of all calls\u2014whether it's happening in our surrounding or coming from our co-workers\u2014it's equally disruptive.Here's the thing: the common solutions available in the market are either headsets with noise-cancelling microphones, or standalone microphones that reduces your background noise pickup. These solutions have 2 things in common\u2014they are expensive, and they only reduce noise happening in your own background.But what if it is your colleague's background noise that's driving you insane? We have the perfect fix with our NoiseClean features that reduces static background noises from both ends\u2014incoming and outgoing audio\u2014of the conversation.    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. NoiseClean-in analyzes your incoming audio (imagine a colleague with a noisy background in your video call), detecting and suppressing the unwanted noises, before sending just your colleague's clean voice to you through your headphones.NoiseClean-out does the same\u2014but for your own background noise.

VoiceDetect Feature:Turn VoiceDetect on / off by clicking on this switch. VoiceDetect requires your default microphone button to be unmuted in order for it to work. When unmuted, it will assume control over your microphone's outgoing audio to automatically unmute when you speak, and mute when you stop.2. Set your speaking volume required to activate the VoiceDetect feature. When set to 'Soft', VoiceDetect gets triggered easily, even when you're speaking softly. When set to \u2018Loud', you're required to speak louder in order to activate VoiceDetect's auto unmute.3.

This allows for better accuracy in voice detection and pickup when you speak.5. Set the amount of time it takes for your microphone to be automatically muted after you have stopped speaking.6.

When activated, NoiseClean-out reduces static noises generated by your environment, so that others can hear you better without the static disruption.8. Set the level of noise that you wish to eliminate based on your current environment. For example, if someone is using a hair dryer directly behind you, we recommend setting this to \u2018High'. If the noise source is from a distance and isn't loud, we recommend setting this to \u2018Low'.9. Check this box if your background noise level varies.

When activated, NoiseClean-in cleans up your co-worker's voice and separates it from any background noise by filtering and allowing only their voice through into your headphones.11. Set the level of noise that you wish to eliminate based on the current background noises that you hear from the call. For example, if the background noise in the call is loud, we recommend setting this to \u2018High'. Likewise, if the background noise sounds soft and from a distance, we recommend setting this to \u2018Low'.12. Check this box if the incoming background noise level varies.

I'm really impressed by the quality of them, and it's nice to have some actual speakers for a change instead of a useless monitor speaker, or wearing headphones all the time.\u0094 - Amber, Creative Pebble\u0093 For USB powered speakers (not powered by 110V AC) and priced around USD $20, these put out a very impressive sound. It's clear and loud enough for any ordinary room. In fact, at full volume, I can listen to the TV in the kitchen, three rooms away.\u0094 - G. Taylor, Creative Pebble\u0093 I REALLY enjoy the clean/clear sound these speakers produce. Owning what I already own, I would have normally laughed at these speakers, and NEVER would have purchased them from a company like Creative (Come on, not really a speaker company...) One word .... AMAZING!\u0094 - John Mi'bo, Creative Pebble V2\u0093 If you are like me, I hate the way my laptop speakers sound. And I was getting tired of wearing headphones and ear buds every time I wanted to enjoy good sound\u07eathe sound from these little babes is awesome.\u0094 - Larry, Creative Pebble V2\u0093 Yep, I've never seen or heard a system this good for anywhere near this price; the Pebble Plus is the king of budget audio.

Wrapped in a stylish sleek housing, the Sound Blaster Roar 2 exudes understated sophistication of a well-designed audio instrument that continues to impress - whether it's in the office, at home or a party.",
        "overview": "Meet the new variant of the critically acclaimed Sound Blaster Roar which has garnered thousands of 5-star reviews. The Sound Blaster Roar 2 is 20% more compact, for a real powerhouse that packs the former's DNA into a smaller frame. The same five high-performance speaker drivers, with the same cutting-edge electrical design and the same battery capacity. This incredible feat is achieved without compromising the same mind-shattering room-filling audio delivered by the classic Sound Blaster Roar.Smaller, Lighter, Sexier & SweeterThe Sound Blaster Roar 2 is specially designed for people who not only appreciate portable speakers for their audio performance, but also for their looks. Wrapped in a stylish sleek housing, the Sound Blaster Roar 2 exudes understated sophistication of a well-designed audio instrument that continues to impress - whether it's in the office, at home or a party.20% SmallerThe Sound Blaster Roar is a marvel of acoustic engineering. When we create Sound Blaster Roar 2, we are pushing the limits of acoustic engineering further, to fit the same components into a 20% smaller1 enclosure. However, good bass requires more physical volume. This time, with a smaller volumetric size, our engineers have to work against the laws of physics to tune the audio to be just as mind-shattering and room-filling, like our classic Sound Blaster Roar.Dual OrientationWhether it's horizontally or vertically placed, the Sound Blaster Roar 2 tunes to your acoustic preference. A horizontal placement lets you experience room-filling and balanced audio. Alternatively, a vertical placement has a smaller footprint but it produces louder and more directed audio and brings the controls on the back panel closer to you. The Sound Blaster Roar 2 is meant to have dual orientation, with your convenience in mind.AudioBi-Amplified Design: Two Amps, Not OneMost portable speakers utilise a single amplifier to reproduce the entire audio spectrum. With a single amplifier design, much demand goes into reproducing the lows and mids, which compromises the delivery of the highs. On the other hand, the Sound Blaster Roar 2 utilises two amplifiers - one dedicated to driving lows and mids, and another is solely dedicated to deliver the high frequencies. This allows the speaker to produce uncompromisingly clear, high definition, and well-balanced music. The top-firing bass and mid-level driver is also laid horizontally, reducing the speaker's center of gravity, thus stabilizing it.Same Five High-performance Speaker DriversDespite having a smaller enclosure, the Sound Blaster Roar 2 houses the same premium five drivers as the Sound Blaster Roar. From the two far-field tweeters, a powerful subwoofer and two unobstructed passive radiators, which are beautifully machine-finished, every element of the design is thoughtfully considered to enhance your audio experience.Clean, Powerful BassThe active 2.5\u2033 driver pumps out impressive mids and lows. Directing the audio upwards also stabilizes the speaker and provides for a wider soundstage that does not require the listener to be situated in the audio sweet spot.Compact, Powerful, High Frequency DriversDurable and lightweight high-frequency drivers deliver balanced highs. These dual 1.5\u0094 premium drivers are also designed to provide far-field high-frequency dispersion.Beautifully Machine-Finished Passive RadiatorsThe Sound Blaster Roar 2 features dual unobstructed passive radiators that deliver unparalleled bass reproduction for a speaker of its class. It not only sounds good, its glossy finish also adds a touch of iridescence to the look. The passive radiators pulsate mesmerizingly \u2212 users can now not only hear the bass, but they can actually feel and see the powerful bass in action.ROAR: Instant No-Holds-Barred Audio PowerGreat for parties or where a larger audience needs to be addressed, the ROAR feature boosts overall loudness and utilizes the speaker's built-in Digital Signal Processor to intelligently widen audio output for bigger and wider sound stage!TeraBass: Intelligently Boosts Bass When Audio Levels Are Low.TeraBass is a feature that intelligently makes up for the perceived loss of bass during low volume playback \u2014 all without artificially over-accentuating bass levels.High Quality Wireless Audio CodecsNot settling for just the basic sub-band coding (SBC) wireless transmission over Bluetooth, the Sound Blaster Roar 2 is also equipped with aptX\u00ae and AAC high definition codecs that deliver high resolution, higher quality wireless Bluetooth audio.Portability8-hour Battery LifeEnjoy up to 8 hours of non-stop music2.Dual Charging ModeOut of juice? No worries, you have two ways to recharge your Sound Blaster Roar 2 - the included power adaptor for fast charge3 and/or the micro USB4.Charge Your SmartphoneWith its high-capacity built-in 6000mAh Li-ion battery, Sound Blaster Roar acts as a charger for your smartphone, whenever you need backup power.ConnectivitySimply tap to pair your NFC-enabled devices to the Sound Blaster Roar 2.You can also connect the Sound Blaster Roar 2 to your PlayStation 45 console via the micro USB cable directly to enjoy all that action with punchy bass and audio clarity.You can also connect your other Bluetooth smart devices wirelessly to the Sound Blaster Roar 2.

With features such as VoiceDetect, which automatically detects your voice and automatically unmutes the mic as you speak, and NoiseClean, a feature that aptly cancels out any unwanted static background noises* during online chats, enjoy more productive and less disruptive calls with just a few clicks of a button.*The NoiseClean features work best for static background noises such as fans, air conditioning, air purifier, humidifiers, vacuum cleaners, hair dryers, electric shavers, and even lawn mowers.SETTING UP THE SMARTCOMMS KIT ON WINDOWS 10 XSUPER EASY SETUPPlug it in, download, and go. The Creative Chat USB lets you communicate smarter in 3 easy steps:Plug in the Creative Chat USB to your Windows PC via the USB-C port.If your computer only has USB-A port, don't worry, we have also included a USB-C to USB-A converter for your use.Download and install the Creative app onto your Windows PC.For new users, start by creating an account with us.For any existing users, you may sign in via any accounts you have with us, like your Creative store account, or other software accounts (e.g., Sound Blaster Command or Sound Blaster Connect).Go to the SmartComms Kit module and make sure that it is switched on.And voila, you're done!To make further adjustments or control each feature individually, access the Advanced settings inside the SmartComms Kit module.Guide to SmartComms Kit's Advanced SettingsAdvanced settings allow you to access and control each feature according to your environment and preferences. For example, you'll be able to set how long it takes for your microphone to be automatically muted after you've stopped talking, or the level of background noise reduction you want on your outgoing audio (what others hear).VoiceDetectAuto Mic Mute / Unmute by Voice Detection1. VoiceDetect Feature:Turn VoiceDetect on / off by clicking on this switch. VoiceDetect requires your default microphone button to be unmuted in order for it to work. When unmuted, it will assume control over your microphone's outgoing audio to automatically unmute when you speak, and mute when you stop.2. Set your speaking volume required to activate the VoiceDetect feature. When set to 'Soft', VoiceDetect gets triggered easily, even when you're speaking softly. When set to \u2018Loud', you're required to speak louder in order to activate VoiceDetect's auto unmute.3. Set the noise level that best describes your current environment noise when using this feature.4. Select the type of microphone you're using. This allows for better accuracy in voice detection and pickup when you speak.5. Set the amount of time it takes for your microphone to be automatically muted after you have stopped speaking.6. Check this box if your voice and background noise level vary. This mode will automatically adjust according to the changes in your voice and background noise as it happens.NoiseClean-out (Outgoing Noise)Two-way Noise Cancellation \u2014 Your Background Noise to Others7. NoiseClean-out Feature:Turn this on to eliminate unwanted background noise from your environment during outgoing calls (what others will hear from you). When activated, NoiseClean-out reduces static noises generated by your environment, so that others can hear you better without the static disruption.8. Set the level of noise that you wish to eliminate based on your current environment. For example, if someone is using a hair dryer directly behind you, we recommend setting this to \u2018High'. If the noise source is from a distance and isn't loud, we recommend setting this to \u2018Low'.9. Check this box if your background noise level varies. This mode will automatically adjust itself according to the changes in your background noise level as it happens.NoiseClean-in (Incoming Noise)Two-way Noise Cancellation \u2014 Background Noise from Others10. NoiseClean-in Feature:Turn this on to eliminate unwanted background noise coming from your co-worker's end during incoming calls. When activated, NoiseClean-in cleans up your co-worker's voice and separates it from any background noise by filtering and allowing only their voice through into your headphones.11. Set the level of noise that you wish to eliminate based on the current background noises that you hear from the call. For example, if the background noise in the call is loud, we recommend setting this to \u2018High'. Likewise, if the background noise sounds soft and from a distance, we recommend setting this to \u2018Low'.12. Check this box if the incoming background noise level varies. This mode will automatically adjust itself according to the incoming background noise level from the call as it happens.ConnectivityFor Work and PlayWith a convenient plug-and-play USB-C interface, the Creative Chat USB headset lets you enjoy enhanced digital audio quality without any interference!

        "features": "Enjoy SuperWide audio on the go with the small and light 5-driver speaker. This spunky companion is well protected from splashes that won't spoil your fun.",
        "overview": "Redefining a LegacyA nod to the legacy of Roar speakers, the advent of the award-winning Creative iRoar Go is a testament to our engineers' relentless pursuit for innovation. Breaking boundaries and pushing limits, the iRoar Go extols the virtues of Roar DNA, along with the same 5-driver design and bi-amp system - all tightly packed into the smallest acoustic chamber yet, without marring the critically acclaimed sound signature.Your audio experience comes alive with depth and immersion that makes you appreciate the aural wonders of SuperWide\u0099 technology. It delivers a sound stage so wide that you won't believe it's coming from this little speaker. Just like its bigger counterparts, the iRoar Go has wireless capabilities, and it multi-tasks as a built-in MP3/FLAC player, voice recorder, Bluetooth speakerphone, an external USB Sound Blaster sound card and a battery bank. Don't let its size fool you, for the iRoar Go is a fearless speaker that's not afraid of water. It is water-resistant with an IPX6 rating so no splashes can spoil your fun. Plus, there's an app that lets you customize the audio, the way you like it.  We designed the iRoar Go to be a good Bluetooth speaker that delivers great audio performance. But through innovative technology and a keen eye for design, the iRoar Go simply delivers more.SuperWideThe iRoar Go delivers more with its built-in SuperWide Technology. SuperWide allows the iRoar Go to deliver a startlingly wide audio  experience from a small device.   The result: a small speaker that sounds like a full-blown stereo system.5-Driver System with Machine-Finished Passive RadiatorsThe iRoar Go boasts an impressive 5-driver system, and this includes dual unobstructed passive radiators. The machine-finished, brushed aluminum drivers pulsate mesmerizingly, so you can actually see powerful bass in action.Water-ResistantThe iRoar Go is designed for users on the move. Its housing is completely splash-proof, allowing users to bring the speaker out to the pool or the beach.   Sound Blaster RoarSep 2014   Sound Blaster Roar 2Jun 2015   Sound Blaster Roar ProNov 2015   Creative iRoarJan 2016   Creative iRoar GoAug 2016Roar2014 Roar 22015 Roar Pro2015 iRoar2016 iRoar Go2016AudioThe Smallest and Lightest 5-driver Speaker25% lighter and 40% smaller than the Creative iRoar, the iRoar Go is the world's smallest and lightest 5-driver Bluetooth speaker with built-in subwoofer, striking the best balance between portability and great audio.5-driver Speaker DesignFrom the two far-field tweeters, a powerful subwoofer and two unobstructed passive radiators, which are beautifully machine-finished, every element of the design is thoughtfully considered to enhance your audio experience.Clean, Powerful BassThe built-in enhanced active 2.5\u2033 Neodymium driver pumps out impressive mids and lows. Directing the audio upwards also stabilizes the speaker and provides for a wider sound stage that does not require the listener to be situated in the audio sweet spot.Compact, Powerful, High Frequency DriversDurable and lightweight high-frequency drivers deliver balanced highs. These dual 1.5\u2033 premium drivers are also designed to provide far-field high-frequency dispersion.Passive RadiatorsThe passive radiators offer more bass enhancement and widening the soundstage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beautifully Machine-finished Passive RadiatorsThe iRoar Go features dual unobstructed passive radiators that deliver unparalleled bass reproduction for a speaker of its size. It not only sounds good, its glossy finish also adds a touch of iridescence to the look. The passive radiators pulsate mesmerizingly \u2212 users can now not only hear the bass, but they can actually feel and see the powerful bass in action. Plus, the dual brushed aluminum rings on the sides add that touch of class.Bi-Amplified Design: Two Amps, Not OneMost portable speakers utilize a single amplifier to reproduce the entire audio spectrum. With a single amplifier design, much demand goes into reproducing the lows and mids, which compromises the delivery of the highs. On the other hand, the iRoar Go utilizes two amplifiers - one dedicated to driving lows and mids, and another is solely dedicated to deliver the high frequencies. This allows the speaker to produce uncompromisingly clear, high definition, and well-balanced music. The top-firing bass and mid-level driver is also laid horizontally, reducing the speaker's center of gravity, thus stabilizing it.Dual OrientationThe iRoar Go offers dual orientation, with your convenience in mind. Whether it's horizontally or vertically placed, the iRoar Go adapts to your acoustic preferences. A horizontal placement lets you experience room-filling and balanced audio. Alternatively, a vertical placement has a smaller footprint but it produces louder and more directed audio and brings the controls on the back panel closer to your reach.SuperWide TechnologyThe iRoar Go is our first speaker, incorporating the SuperWide technology that delivers a startlingly wide audio experience from a small device. This ground-breaking technology stretches audio beyond the limits of conventional acoustic design laws, as it requires a huge amount of acoustic power that's not possible for a speaker of this size. Our engineers have thoughtfully tuned the speaker as a holistic audio system where the algorithm must work intricately with the amplifiers and its architecture to deliver this magic behind its audio prowess.Getting More Out of SuperWide TechnologyExperience the performance of the SuperWide Technology and enjoy it in four different placement scenarios.SuperWide Stereo ImagingPlace the speaker vertically on a table to experience a startlingly wide sound stage and stereo image beyond one's imagination.Enhanced SuperWide Stereo ImagingPlacing the speaker vertically up against the wall at ear level harnesses the resonant properties of the wall surface behind the speaker where the whole wall, along with the speaker, projects an even wider stereo image that can be experienced anywhere throughout the room.SuperWide Stereo Imaging with DispersionPlacing the speaker horizontally on the table, it boasts a wide stereo image with a distinct positional audio. So you can sit back, relax and pick up the instruments' magical appearances in the track playing at different parts of the sound stage around you.SuperWide Room-filling Ambient DispersionTake your enjoyment up a notch by placing the speaker horizontally close to the ceiling. Experience an ambient dispersion of audio as though it comes from several speakers all around the room, instead of a single speaker source.SuperWide Stereo ImagingEnhanced SuperWide Stereo ImagingSuperWide Stereo Imaging with DispersionSuperWide Room-filling Ambient DispersionROAR: Instant No-holds-barred Audio PowerGreat for parties or where a larger audience needs to be addressed, the ROAR feature boosts the overall loudness and utilizes the speaker's built-in Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to intelligently widen audio output for a bigger and wider sound stage!TeraBass: Intelligently Boosts Bass When Audio Levels are LowUpdated for the iRoar Go, ROAR mode now incorporates TeraBass processing and intelligently compensates for the human ear's loss of perceived bass and treble details during low playback level as well - dramatically improving the fullness and clarity of your music even at whisper low volumes.Equalizer: It Tunes to a Sound Profile Uniquely YoursThe Equalizer mode allows you to customize the sound of iRoar Go to your listening preferences. This mode also provides a variety of expertly tuned presets for you to choose from.Download the Sound Blaster Connect app to explore the endless possibilities of the Equalizer mode.DesignAn Award-winning DesignThe iRoar Go is recognized for its well-thought design that earns itself the Red Dot Award 2016. The speaker has upped the ante by packing all that engineering goodness for great, balanced sound, in a form so small that's unprecedented by others. With a simple user interface, durable material selection, and an IPX6 rating, the speaker certainly has set a benchmark for many to follow.Party All You Want, Without Splashes Spoiling the FunThe iRoar Go is designed with an IPX6 rating, which makes the speaker water-resistant. So go ahead and take your music to the pool, or the beach and roll with the good times!Built-in ControlsThe iRoar Go comes with built-in controls now, to give you easy access to your playlist whenever, wherever.3ConnectivityBluetoothConsider the iRoar Go as the jukebox of your dreams. Let the wireless convenience of Bluetooth connectivity inspire your friends to take the stage and inject life into your party.Bluetooth SpeakerphoneWhile your smartphone is tethered via Bluetooth, the iRoar Go acts as a wireless speakerphone that lets you take your calls when you're listening to your music. Who says you cannot mix business with pleasure?\u00a0Near Field Communication (NFC)All it takes is one tap on the iRoar Go, and you're on the way to a playlist of endless hits that gets you grooving.USB AudioConnect the iRoar Go to a PC or Mac via micro USB, and it will function as a host audio and microphone device like an external Sound Blaster sound card. For the PC and Mac users, download the Sound Blaster Connect software to enjoy the benefits of intelligent enhancements for your PC or Mac audio in real time.USB Audio for Your PS4For the gamers, you can rejoice now that you can connect the iRoar Go to your PlayStation\u00ae4 console via the micro USB cable directly to enjoy all that action with punchy bass and audio clarity.Built-in MP3/FLAC PlayerNow, you can play your entire music collection2 directly from the iRoar Go. Simply insert a microSD card or USB thumb drive that contains your favorite songs and press the Play button to enjoy a fantastic listening experience. Alternatively, you could also refer to your favorite tracks from the Sound Blaster Connect.Built-in Voice RecorderThe iRoar Go comes with a built-in microphone that picks up your voice. So you can record your productive discussion with your business partner with a simple touch of a button. Alternatively, you can connect an external microphone via the Aux-in port.Next Generation Personal Public Address (PA) SystemAlso made for professionals, this powerful Bluetooth speaker doubles as a personal PA system that helps you deliver a compelling performance in your presentation, conference, and classes!

Directing the audio upwards not only stabilises the speaker, but also provides for a wider soundstage that doesn't require the listener to be situated in the audio sweet spot.Even More Bass EnhancementIt is further enhanced with dual opposing, side-firing passive radiators that widen the soundstage dramatically.Acoustically Optimized Speaker DesignThe rigid monocoque endoskeleton chassis has fewer internal components that vibrate individually. This translates into lesser energy wastage and better audio quality.Powerful, High Frequency DriversDurable and lightweight improved high frequency drivers deliver balanced highs. These dual 2\u2033 premium drivers are also designed to provide far-field high frequency dispersion.SB-Axx1\u0099 Digital Audio ProcessorOf course, such a collaborative sound system wouldn't be made possible without the intelligence of our proprietary processor, SB-Axx1\u0099. The SB-Axx1 is an audio Digital Signal Processor (DSP) that enhances your audio experience with clarity.A custom-built audio processor is utilised across all our top performance Sound Blaster products such as the Sound Blaster ZxR, Sound Blaster X7 and the Sound Blaster E5, SB-Axx1 processor provide the computing power required by the iRoar to enhance your audio in real time, giving you superior listening experience for your music, movies and voice calls.Bi-amplified Design: Two Amps, Not OneWhile many other portable speakers produce small, constrained sound, the Creative iRoar is designed to deliver powerful space-filling audio. Most portable speakers utilise a single amplifier to reproduce the entire audio spectrum. With the traditional single amplifier design, much demand goes into reproducing the lows and mids, which compromises the delivery of the highs.Through much research and development, the iRoar is designed to accommodate 5 speaker drivers, including a active 2.75\u2033 driver, into a compact booklet-sized form factor. Dual lightweight high-frequency 2\u2033 drivers project far-field high-frequency dispersion while a top-firing active 2.75\u2033 driver pushes bass outwards; and this is enhanced by two side-firing, opposing passive radiators that spreads out the bass even further. The compact powerful iRoar also features 2 high-performance amplifiers - one dedicated to driving lows and mids, another solely for delivering highs - producing clear, spacious, well-balanced audio without compromising on the bass.Audio PerformanceSpace-filling DispersionThe result of all this is that iRoar is able to deliver powerful room-filling audio that is not sweet spot-dependant. When it comes to the speaker stability at high volume levels, the iRoar comes second to none; unlike top-heavy, front/rear-designed speakers that vibrate and move position at high volume levels, the iRoar is stable as a rock even while blasting at maximum volume.Designed for acoustic performance, the top-firing active 2.75\u2033 driver is laid horizontally which increases stability while its rigid monocoque endoskeletal chassis reduces internal components that can vibrate individually. So what you hear is pristine music from an extremely stable speaker, free of annoying vibrations and rattle.ROAR Mode: Instant No-holds-barred Audio PowerDon't be fooled by its size. By default, it produces balanced, high-fidelity audio. And in scenarios where sheer audio power is needed - in large parties and social gatherings, for instance - users can press the ROAR button that instantly boosts the loudness, depth and spaciousness of the audio.All you need is to tap on the ROAR button and let the iRoar take care of the rest.Touch ControlsIntelligent Touch ControlsIntelligent Touch Controls are adaptive and context sensitive based on the selected mode of the speaker. The relevant buttons light up to show the relevant controls that matter to you. ConnectivityBluetooth\u00ae HD Audio PlaybackThe iRoar supports Bluetooth aptX Low Latency codec in addition to AAC, which are advanced HD codecs that deliver high quality audio for Bluetooth transmission. These codecs \u2014 supported by branded Android phones and the iPhone, are crucial for great wireless audio and they are not even found in many premium wireless speakers. With low latency, you can enjoy your games or watch movies without delays. In other words, no interferences with your video and virtual gameplay!Plus, the Creative Multipoint3 lets you multi-task with up to two devices connected simultaneously.MP3/M4A (AAC)/WAV PlaybackYou can play your entire music collection directly from the iRoar without relying on your mobile phone.

        "overview": "At the intersection where today's cutting-edge audiophile technology meets 30 years of Sound Blaster processing experience, we set out to redefine the best of PC audio. Paying homage to our audio enhancement legacy and our never-waning thirst to explore the possibilities of audio, the Sound Blaster AE-9 is quite simply the best PCI-e sound card we have ever made.Marrying the best of hardware with a 129 dB DNR and 32-bit / 384 kHz playback from the hi-res ESS SABRE-class reference DAC and our very own Xamp fully Discrete Headphone Bi-amplifier, together with our critically-acclaimed Sound Blaster audio processing technology that has been refined and perfected over the last 3 decades, the AE-9 can be described with a single word \u2014 pristine.And it's not just specifications. We have put in thought into every single aspect of the product, including the launch of a brand-new feature \u2014 the CleanLine Technology, engineered from ground up to eliminate voltage rail issues and isolate noise along the mic path for crystal clear voice communications.Audio QualityA Feast for Your EarsThe Sound Blaster AE-9 is built with the absolute best components to deliver pristine, detailed audio quality that would satisfy even the most demanding audiophile.The core of the Sound Blaster AE-9 is the flagship audiophile-grade hi-res ESS SABRE-class 9038 DAC. It delivers an ultra-high DNR of 129 dB, 32-bit 384 kHz playback over PCM, DSD64, and an incredibly low Total Harmonic Distortion of -120 dB (0.0001%).CleanLine TechnologyOur newest innovation \u2014 CleanLine Technology \u2014 is set to overthrow the need of an external desktop mixer that takes up the desktop's valuable real estate.The CleanLine Technology is designed to filter and isolate noise along the mic path so you can truly enjoy crystal clear and uncompromised voice communications even while your GPU is pushing its limits.High-performance GPUs pack heavy workload onto their boards, causing power supply ripple noise that manifests into audible noise and distortion when the microphone signal is amplified.The AE-9's CleanLine technology features a specially designed circuitry and components that eliminates voltage rail issues and isolates noise along the microphone path that typically plagues internal audio cards. In addition, we utilize a differential drive for the mic signal to reduce the common mode noise that may be induced by other electronic sources.Xamp Headphone Bi-ampTerrific for HeadphonesThe Sound Blaster AE-9 is designed to bring out the best in any headphone.It boasts the fully discrete Xamp Headphone Bi-amplifier that amplifies each audio channel individually, delivering pristine audio in an unaltered lossless mode to each earcup regardless of demand.The Sound Blaster AE-9 works with all kinds of headphones, driving audiophile-grade headphones up to 600\u03a9, all the way to sensitive in-ear monitors with its ultra-low 1\u03a9 headphone output impedance.The Xamp Discrete Headphone Bi-amplifierThe Xamp discrete headphone amplifier uses a dual-amp design to amplify each audio channel individually for pristine, uncompromised audio. It utilizes a push-pull output stage design to achieve good amplification.Each audio channel (Left and Right) goes through 3 stages of separate amplification circuits:1. Voltage Amplification StageThe differential signal from the DAC is fed into a Low Pass Filter comprising of WIMA film / foil capacitors, followed by a single-ended amplifier to condition the signal for 2nd stage processing.2. Pre-Amp StageThe input signal is further amplified to achieve an increase in current and power gain to drive the final output stage.3. Output StageThis stage gives further improvement to the power gain and transfers this power to the headphone with minimum loss. The push-pull design, consisting of transistors, is employed to achieve better efficiency, higher power output and cancellation of even-order harmonics at the final output stage.SWIPE TO LEARN MORE1.
